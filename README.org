** Quick Start

1. Backup your current Emacs config:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
  #+END_SRC

2. Clone this repository:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    git clone https://github.com/StefanChristians/emacsedi.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

3. Start Emacs. Required packages will be automatically installed.

4. Create a new C++ project:
   - Right-click in the Treemacs frame → =Projects= → =Create New C++ Project=
   - Choose project type: Simple, Standard, Library, or Large

** Project Types

- *Simple*: All source files in a single directory for quick proof-of-concept projects
- *Standard*: Separate `app` and `core`, includes documentation and localization
- *Library*: Stand-alone, shareable libraries with headers in `include`
- *Large*: Multiple independent modules, each with their own sources, headers, and tests

** Features

Some highlighted user-facing functionality:

- *Code navigation & completion*: LSP support with [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] and [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]]
- *Syntax highlighting*: Modern C++ highlighting ([[https://github.com/ludwigpacifici/modern-cpp-font-lock][modern-cpp-font-lock]])
- *Project management*: Tree view of files, quick open, workspace handling ([[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][treemacs]])
- *Version control*: Git integration ([[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]), view changes inline ([[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]])
- *Convenience*: Auto-insert boilerplate code, snippet templates ([[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]]), cursor beacon, code folding, code completion
- *Debugging*: Debugging with GDB or LLDB

** Configuration (Advanced)

- Packages are loaded and configured via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/use-package/][use-package]] in ~init.el~
- C++ project defaults are defined in ~ide-cpp.el~ and can be overridden in the ~(use-package ide-cpp.el)~ call at the end of ~init.el~
- Auto-text blocks are defined as `yasnippet` templates in the ~snippets/~ directory
