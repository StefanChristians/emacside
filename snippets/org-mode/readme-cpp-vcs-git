** Version Control System

The version control system used to track changes is Git.

To keep the main line of code clean, switch to a development branch before making any modifications.
When you are done, switch back to the main branch and merge in your changes.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
\$ git switch -c dev # create the dev branch and switch to it
\$
\$ ... # make some modifications
\$
\$ git add . # stage your changes
\$ git commit -m "fix: correct the calculation" # commit your changes (see next section)
\$ git switch main # switch back to main branch
\$ git merge dev # merge branch dev into main
\$ git branch -d dev # delete the dev branch if it is no longer needed
#+END_SRC
