* Quick Start

This software uses [[https://cmake.org/][CMake]] as build system generator.

To build the software, change to the project root directory and run CMake:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
\$ cmake -B path/to/output/directory
#+END_SRC

This configures and generates the build system using default compilers and generators.
Refer to the [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html][CMake documentation]] and following chapters for selecting specific compilers, generators, and other command line arguments.

The output directory is arbitrary.
Common choices are ~build~ or ~/tmp/build~.

After generating the build system, run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
\$ cmake --build path/to/output/directory
#+END_SRC

to compile and link the software.

When changing configuration parameters, delete the output directory and re-run CMake for a clean build.
