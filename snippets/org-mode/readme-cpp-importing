** Importing to other CMake Projects

Development targets installed using ~cmake --install --component=devel~ are configured to be imported into other CMake projects with ~find_package()~.

If the targets have not been installed in the search path of ~find_package()~ (for example, because they were installed in a staging directory), the installation location needs to be passed to the importing project by setting ~CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH~ when configuring the build system:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
\$ # in importing project's project root:
\$ cmake -B path/to/output/directory -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/exported/installation/location
#+END_SRC
